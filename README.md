Homework 3

In this project I wrote an application to generate a randomized password made up of upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and a length between 8 and 128 characters--all criteria to be specified by the user via prompts and confirms that would result in the password being displayed onscreen in the text box.

This was a very tricky assignment because I'm still figuring out how to order functions and arrays, and what commands to use to hook everything together. One basic and helpful thing I learned was to first declare global variables at the top, then move through functions that hold results to be used in the following function and so forth; create individual functions for arrays that hold categories of characters, then apply "if" statements to each category to push choices into an empty array, which later gets randomized and saved into a variable that gets written to the text box in the browser. 

Honestly I don't totally understand what is happening from line 69 to 78. This is where I got the most help and I haven't been able to understand the mechanics of it. My questions are in the comments there, I'd like help understanding how it works!
